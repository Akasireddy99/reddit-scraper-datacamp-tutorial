# Reddit Scraper for DataCamp Tutorial

## Introduction

This is a working example of a web scraper written with Python and BeautifulSoup 4, which was written for to accompany a tutorial written for DataCamp. The scraper extracts information (title, author, likes, comments) of the first 1000 posts in a specified subreddit. The default subreddit is r/datascience. The link will be posted here upon publishing of the tutorial. 

## Setup

All the libraries used in this example can be installed using pip with the requirements.txt file included. Open any terminal or command prompt and type in the following line.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Using the Scraper

Since this is an accompaniment to a tutorial, there won't be a full description of the code here. You can run the script and see the results of the script by using `python reddit_scraper.py`.
